## Summary
A homage to the classic game Space Invaders. The player rotates on a fixed point has a laser to shoot the space invaders. 
The goal of the game is to eliminate all the enemies and avoid taking damage to get the highest score. 
The invaders will also shoot projectiles at the player, so the player will have to do their best to shield these projectiles to avoid taking damage.

The player will be situated on a platform and must defend against invaders as they circle in on the platform and player, 
similar to the Mario Party minigame Saucer Swarm, shown below.
