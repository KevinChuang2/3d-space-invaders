## Summary
A homage to the classic game Space Invaders. The player defends a fortress that is armed with a laser with which to shoot the space invaders. 
The invaders will circle in on the player as depicted below.
The goal of the game is to eliminate the invaders and avoid taking damage for as long as possible in order to get the highest score. 
The invaders can damage the player via direct contact or poisonous balls of goo, the latter of which the player must put up a shield for to avoid taking damage.

The player loses when they no longer have any lives left.
